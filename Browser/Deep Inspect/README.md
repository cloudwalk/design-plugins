# QA Design Feedback - Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension designed to streamline communication between designers and developers by providing visual feedback directly on web pages.

## Overview

QA Design Feedback is a powerful tool that allows designers to provide precise, contextual feedback on web applications. By enabling direct annotation on web elements, it bridges the gap between design vision and implementation.

## Key Features

### Element Selection System
- Interactive element selection tool
- Visual highlighting of selectable components
- Clear indication of selected elements

### Comment System
- Comment bubbles anchored to specific elements
- Rich text editor for detailed feedback
- Automatic positioning system for comment bubbles

### Categorization
- Predefined problem categories:
  - User Interface (UI)
  - User Experience (UX)
  - Visual Bugs
  - Accessibility
  - Responsiveness
- Color-coded feedback system
- Visual distinction between different types of feedback

### Capture and Management
- Screenshot capture functionality
- Comment storage and organization
- Export system for developer handoff

## How It Works

1. **Activation**: Enable the extension on the target webpage
2. **Selection**: Click on any element you want to comment on
3. **Feedback**: Add your comment in the popup bubble
4. **Categorization**: Select the type of feedback

6. **Export**: Generate a comprehensive report with screenshots

## Export Features

The extension exports feedback in two formats:
1. A screenshot with numbered markers showing feedback locations

All exports are automatically packaged in a ZIP file named with the page URL and current date.
